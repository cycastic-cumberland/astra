Astra is a lightweight, embeddable, tabular database for simple and effective caching of structured data.

To use Astra in TCP server mode, clone this repo and build `Astra.Server` 

## Features (or roadmap perhaps?)

- [x] Embeddable engine
- [x] TCP server
- [ ] Multiple tables

- [ ] Sub-microsecond insertion?
