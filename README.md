# Astra

Astra is a lightweight, tabular database for fast and effective caching of structured data.

## Requirement

Requires .NET 8 for both client and server (there is no good reason for this, I just don't know how to install .NET 6 on Arch Linux)

## Getting Started

To use Astra in TCP server mode, clone this repo and build `Astra.Server` 

## Features (or roadmap perhaps?)

- [x] Embeddable engine
- [x] TCP server
- [x] Working client
